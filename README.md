# Array Methods Example Program

This program demonstrates various array methods in JavaScript using an interactive command-line interface (CLI). It allows you to select from a list of array methods and see examples of how each method works.

## Features

- Interactive CLI using the Inquirer.js library.
- Demonstrates the following array methods:
  - `push`: Adds an element to the end of an array.
  - `unshift`: Adds an element to the beginning of an array.
  - `shift`: Removes the first element from an array.
  - `pop`: Removes the last element from an array.
  - `map`: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
  - `filter`: Creates a new array with elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function.
  - `slice`: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array.
  - `reverse`: Reverses the order of the elements in an array.
- Allows continuous operation or exiting the program.
